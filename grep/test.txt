The NATS Streaming library uses the NATS library to connect to a NATS
Server and indirectly communicates with the NATS Streaming "server".
To better understand the issues, you should assume that the server
has no direct connection with the client, and the client may possibly
never lose its TCP connection to a NATS Server and yet may not have
access to a streaming server (streaming client connected to a Server,
that is cluster to another, to which the NATS Streaming "server" is connected to).
